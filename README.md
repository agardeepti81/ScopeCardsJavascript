# ScopeCardsJavascript
First version of scope cards using JavaScript and AWS API

This project was intended to create the scope cards for a subject that is assigned to the students of an organization. 
I used AWS APIs to fetch data from the server and display the scope cards based on that data using their pervious stored state. In the next stage if user is completing any new questions that progress is also stored on the server.
